    <h1>FACTORIAL</h1>
    <p>
    Factorial is a mathematical operation that multiplies all positive
    integers less than or equal to a given positive integer. 
    It is denoted by that integer and an exclamation point, 
    for example, 7! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7. 
    Factorials are commonly encountered in the evaluation of
    permutations and combinations and in the 
    coefficients of terms of binomial expansions. To  calculate a factorial, 
    you can use the formula n! = n x (n-1)!,
    where n is the number you want to calculate the factorial of. 
    For example, to calculate 6!, you would multiply 6 by 5!,which is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1.
